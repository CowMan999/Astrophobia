# Astrophobia
An open-sorce action bullet hell game made with C++/SFML

## Requrements For Complimation

Windows device (sorry to all the linux/mac folks, but this is reliant on certain Windows API functions.)

C++17 complient compiler

SFML (Tested with 2.5.1)


## Complimation

Simply compile ```main.cpp``` into an executable as you usualy would with SFML projects. It includes all other files, and thus is all that is needed.


## Download

If you just want to play the game, downloads are available at https://cowman9999.itch.io/astrophobia
